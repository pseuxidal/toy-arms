/*
This is the demonstration of how to use external feature of toy-arms.
Following code is trying to get process id and process handle first, then getting a value called dwClientState_state.
Then showing the way to overwrite value at dwForceAttack to make player shoot.
The offset DW_CLIENT_STATE, DW_CLIENT_STATE_STATE and DW_FORCE_ATTACK work as of the day i wrote this but it might not be up to date in your case.
